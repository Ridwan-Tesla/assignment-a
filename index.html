          <p>One thing that makes goals so difficult to achieve is that it’s hard to stay focused enough to keep working towards them. Many of us blame distractions such as work, family, or technology and say that’s the reason why we have a hard time concentrating on our goals.</p>

              Efficiency is one of the most important thing to stay focused. Taling to others, taking frequent break decreases our efficiency level thus, decreasing our productivity. When we are working it is important to ensure that we are not thinking about anything else.

            <p>We should try to stay away from the things that can distract us during work. As example for phone. We should keep our phone silent so that it doesnt distract us when we are working. And we should keep things close those are necessary for us.</p>

            <p>If we dont take care of health then it is almost impossible for us to be productive. We need to stay hydrated. A hungry person can not focus on his work properly. So we need to take our meal at appropriate time so that we can focus on our work properly.</p>

            <p>Confidence is another thing that can help us to stay focused. A person who is more conffident can focus on his work more than a person who is not confident. So we need to stay confident and believe in ourself. We should thin positive and bepositive.
